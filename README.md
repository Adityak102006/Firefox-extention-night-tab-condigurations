I did some configurations to my firefox so that it looks more better with hyprland using extention so I am sharing my configurations so that you all can use it for your own browser
And I'll be making more themes for firefox I used the extention night tab and configured it and you all don't have to go through all the process.
This is the first theme I made Hope you like it.

Steps to add the config to night tab
1. Download the night tab extention
2. Open the new page you will see the raw structure of the extention
3. Open the settings given in the extention in header
4. Scroll down and click on data
5. and Import the file to your browser

Setting night tab as default whenever you open your browser
1. Go to your browser settings and then go to home settings
2. use custom urls
3. then click on current page option (make sure you open the night tab in new tab and don't open any website other than that until you are finished)

If you have already made your own themes you can add your config here, contributions will be appreciated.
Thank you
